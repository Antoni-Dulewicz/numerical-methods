to restrain the Spaniards, stationed beneath the gallows on which the
servants had been hanged. The heads of the burghers almost touched the
feet of these martyrs. Thirty feet from this group was a block, and
on it glittered a scimitar. An executioner was present in case Juanito
refused his obedience at the last moment.

Soon the Spaniards heard, in the midst of the deepest silence, the steps
of many persons, the measured sound of the march of soldiers, and the
slight rattle of their accoutrements. These noises mingled with the gay
laughter of the officers, as a few nights earlier the dances of a ball
had served to mask the preparations for a bloody treachery. All
eyes turned to the chateau and saw the noble family advancing with
inconceivable composure. Their faces were serene and calm.

One member alone, pale, undone, leaned upon the priest, who spent his
powers of religious consolation upon this man,--the only one who was to
live. The executioner knew, as did all present, that Juanito had agreed
to accept his place for that one day. The old marquis and his wife,
Clara, Mariquita, and the two younger brothers walked forward and knelt
down a few steps distant from the fatal block. Juanito was led forward
by the priest. When he reached the place the executioner touched him
on the arm and gave him, probably, a few instructions. The confessor,
meantime, turned the victims so that they might not see the fatal blows.
But, like true Spaniards, they stood erect without faltering.

Clara was the first to come forward.

"Juanito," she said, "have pity on my want of courage; begin with me."

At this instant the hurried steps of a man were heard, and Victor
Marchand appeared on the terrace. Clara was already on her knees, her
white neck bared for the scimitar. The officer turned pale, but he ran
with all his might.

"The general grants your life if you will marry me," he said to her in a
low voice.

The Spanish girl cast upon the officer a look of pride and contempt.

"Go on, Juanito!" she said, in a deep voice, and her head rolled at
Victor's feet.

The Marquise de Leganes made one convulsive movement as she heard that
sound; it was the only sign she gave of sorrow.

"Am I placed right this way, my good Juanito?" asked the little Manuelo
of his brother.

"Ah! you are weeping, Mariquita!" said Juanito to his sister.

"Yes," she said, "I think of you, my poor Juanito; how lonely you will
be without us."

Soon the grand figure of the marquis came forward. He looked at the
blood of his children; he turned to the mute and motionless spectators,
and said in a strong voice, stretching his hands toward Juanito,--

"Spaniards! I give my son my fatherly blessing! Now, _Marquis_, strike,
without fear--you are without reproach."

But when Juanito saw his mother approach him, supported by the priest,
he cried out: "She bore me!"

A cry of horror broke from all present. The noise of the feast and the
jovial laughter of the officers ceased at that terrible clamor.
The marquise comprehended that Juanito's courage was exhausted, and
springing with one bound over the parapet, she was dashed to pieces
on the rocks below. A sound of admiration rose. Juanito had fallen
senseless.

"General," said an officer, who was half drunk, "Marchand has just told
me the particulars of that execution down there. I will bet you never
ordered it."

"Do you forget, messieurs," cried General G--t--r, "that five hundred
French families are plunged in affliction, and that we are now in Spain?
Do you wish to leave our bones in its soil?"

After that allocution, no one, not even a sub-lieutenant, had the
courage to empty his glass.

In spite of the respect with which he is surrounded, in spite of the
title El Verdugo (the executioner) which the King of Spain bestowed as a
title of nobility on the Marquis de Leganes, he is a prey to sorrow; he
lives in solitude, and is seldom seen. Overwhelmed with the burden of
his noble crime, he seems to await with impatience the birth of a second
son, which will give him the right to rejoin the Shades who ceaselessly
accompany him.
